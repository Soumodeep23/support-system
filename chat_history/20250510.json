    "response": " Based on the provided context, it seems that the solutions for the Network Connectivity Issues are to try reinstalling the app, clearing app cache and relogging, or checking the app permissions for Local Network. Since your Wi-Fi is working fine but your app is unable to connect, I would suggest trying to clear the app cache and relog first (as this is a common solution across multiple tickets). If that doesn't work, you could also check the app permissions for Local Network to make sure they are properly set up. If you continue to experience issues after these steps, it might be best to contact the app support for further assistance.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Here's a possible fix you can try:\n\nIt looks like you're facing an issue related to: issue, no internet connection.\n\nLet's try to troubleshoot this together! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nIf it still doesn't work, let me know and I can guide you further!\n\n\n\u2705 Let me know if that helps or if you need more assistance."

    "response": " Based on the provided context, it seems that some network connectivity issues are being addressed with solutions like reinstalling the app (TECH_026, TECH_032), clearing app cache and relogging (TECH_025, TECH_032), and checking app permissions for Local Network (TECH_024). Since your issue is similar to these tickets, you might try the following steps:\n\n1. Clear the app's cache - If there's a bug or corrupted data in the cache, this could solve the problem.\n2. Reinstall the app - Uninstalling and reinstalling the app can help refresh it and potentially resolve any underlying issues.\n3. Check the app permissions for Local Network - Ensure that your app has permission to access your local network, as this could be the cause of connectivity issues within the app itself.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Here's a possible fix you can try:\n\nIt looks like you're facing an issue related to: issue, no internet connection.\n\nLet's try to troubleshoot this together! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nIf it still doesn't work, let me know and I can guide you further!\n\n\n\u2705 Let me know if that helps or if you need more assistance."

    "response": "1) In the context provided, there seems to be a recurring issue with Payment Gateway Integration Failure marked as Critical and Urgent. The solutions suggested in different tickets involve verifying SSL certificate settings (Ticket ID TECH_034), using a different gateway API (Tech_035), upgrading the server to TLS 1.3 (Tech_033), and checking server firewall settings (Tech_036). However, none of these solutions directly addresses your specific issue, which is the error 'Invalid SSL certificate.' Even though your certificate is valid and up-to-date, it might be worth trying the following steps:\n\n   - Ensure that the server is using the correct SSL certificate.\n   - Verify that the server is configured to trust the current SSL certificate you are using.\n   - If applicable, check if there are any intermediary certificates required for your SSL certificate and ensure they are also properly installed on the server.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, I would recommend reaching out to your system administrator or the Payment Gateway support team for further assistance.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Here's a possible fix you can try:\n\nIt looks like you're facing an issue related to: error, integration.\n\nLet's try to troubleshoot this together! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nIf it still doesn't work, let me know and I can guide you further!\n\n\n\u2705 Let me know if that helps or if you need more assistance."
